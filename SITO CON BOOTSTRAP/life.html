						<h2>My Life</h2>
						</div>
						<!-- paragraph -->
						<p>I was born in Alba on June 18, 2003. I have lived since I was born in Grinzane Cavour, a small 
						hill village immersed in the Langhe. My village is famous for its castle which, every year, hosts the "International
						Alba's white truffle fair". I regularly attended the asylum and elementary schools in my town 
						of residence. In this first part of my life I received, in my view, a correct education that 
						formed me humanly both by my parents and by my aunt who looked  me during their working hours.
						Instead, I attended middle school in Diano d'Alba, a town close to mine. When I was about 5 years I started
						practicing sports at the football association of my country, a passion that has strengthened over
						the years. In elementary school I had a "boom" towards reading, I would call it an intensive passion
						which, after a few years, has faded. Probably the cause was the frequency with which I "consumed"
						these books: in fact in not even one afternoon I was able to finish even more than one! Even 
						today my library jealously keeps the numbered and ordered copies of titles like Geronimo Stilton
						and above all "Gol". Also in the period of elementary / middle schools, <a href="passioni.html">sport</a> and in particular football 
						led me to cultivate another beautiful passion (which for a number of reasons I no longer follow today): collecting the
						stickers of the players in the historic Panini album. Collecting stickers, for me, every year
						was first of all an exhausting wait since the album was released in January-February, you can ask
						my parents for my obsession with its release so much that every day in the winter I
						asked: << Is the album out? >>. Once out it was a source of union between me and my friends as
						swapping the stickers to try to complete the album was a daily event (not forgetting the attempts to rub friends to
						get the most wanted players with exchanges advantageous). Finally, this passion has allowed me to
						 make some beautiful and new experiences in Turin, a place where fans find themselves exchanging stickers.
						I can consider it one of the most beautiful passions of my life although it did not last long even
						though, however, I managed to complete 3 albums. A passion in particular probably changed my future: that for video
						games. At the time of choosing secondary school, in fact, I was oriented towards a high school
						course. Intrigued, however, by the world of technology (and therefore also of video games) I decided to visit the
						Vallauri Institute of Fossano. I was very impressed with the structure and activities of the school and  
						at the end I chose this last institute. Now I'm attending the 3 ^ B Informatica class. Among the most beautiful
						experiences of my life there are certainly the school camps organized by my parish priest that I
						have attended for over 6 years. For 3 years I have been playing the role of animator towards younger children.
						I consider these experiences "enriching" in the same way as a journey in that they make us 
						understand the true essence of being together. We are free from any disturbing object such as 
						cell phones and television for most of the day, therefore our sociality with peers and the relationship with younger
						children is tested and often improved. To conclude, I consider myself a person who improves over
						the years but, in general, I define myself a boy who is shy but also very funny once you know me.
						I often update myself on what is happening around thw world watching social networks or news programs, for this reason I consider
						myself a very serious person who is able to understand the most complicated life dynamics.
